# Project Title - Gratitude Journal

# Project Description 
To create a full stack application where users can log gratitudes, be presented with inspiring quotes, tasks to show gratitude and communicate with friends.

# User outcome
As a user I want to remind myself of all that is good in the world and spread this through random acts of kindness

# User Story 

WHEN I first arrive at the webpage, I login my username and password.
THEN I am redirected to a journal 'page' and presented with an inspiring quote.
THEN I can enter three things I am grateful for and save.
WHEN I click on a date in the calendar I can look back on past gratitudes.
